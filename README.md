# TWENTYONEGAME

Twenty one. A class project. Made by me and my classmates Arguien, and Hunt at Iona University in Intro to Comp Sci. 

The purpose of this project was to create a program that could play twenty one for as long as the user would like to, as well using simple logic, if and elif statements, and creating our own functions. An algorithm must be created to show the design process of the people making the project. We must also include up to three test cases, one for if the dealer and user tied, one for if the user wins, and one for if the dealer wins. Beyond that, we can anything to make the dealer feel nice to play with.
